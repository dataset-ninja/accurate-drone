**Accurate Drone Shapes/Segmentation** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the drone inspection domain. 

The dataset consists of 9049 images with 9047 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*drone*).

Images in the Accurate Drone Shapes dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. There are 2 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2021 by the [MetaVision, Ukraine](https://metavision.zone/).
