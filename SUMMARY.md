**Accurate drone shapes** is a dataset for instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the aviation industry. 

The dataset consists of 9049 images with 9047 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*drone*).

Images in the Accurate drone shapes dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 2 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (9049 images). The dataset was released in 2021.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
